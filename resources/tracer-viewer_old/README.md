## What is this!?

This code was the result of a hackathon where we tried to build a tracer with a tree view, rather than a tabular view. Although I was happy with the results at the end of the hackathon, the format did not result in the best code.

The tracer-client was inspired by this hackathon, and once it is in good shape I will likely create a new project for tracer-viewer. All the code in this folder is just here for safe keeping.
