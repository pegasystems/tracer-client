# Tracer

This repository now contains multiple sub-projects which support a modern 
web experience for the Tracer rule profiling tool.

Each project has it's own readme to provide additional information and
command line utilities.

This project uses [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multiple sub projects. To install and build
all subprojects run the following commands

```
// Install lerna
npm install 

// Download dependencies for all projects
npm run install-all

// Build all child projects
npm run build-all
```
